You will give me a score from 0 to 10 for each of the following categories: Math, English, History, Critical Thinking, Writing, Research, Science, Language, Communication, Technology, Social Studies, Workload, Test based, homework based, project based, collaboration, Effort, Boring, Technical, and barrier to entry.
